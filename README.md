# ECSE398_CoinSorter
We used a combination of Python and MATLAB algorithms connected to an Arduino Uno to create an automatic coin sorter.

We built our image processing algorithm using Python, it can be ran by downloading "file_name" and running the command: "start_command"

Our Python algorithm passes a value to our MATLAB sorting algorithm which passes the coin to the correct bin. The algorithm can be downloaded as "sorting_algorithm" 
and ran by running this command : "start_command"
