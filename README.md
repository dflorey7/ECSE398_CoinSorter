# ECSE398_CoinSorter
The goal of our project entails useing a combination of Python and MATLAB algorithms connected to an Arduino Uno to create an automatic coin sorter.

We built our image processing algorithm using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This file was passed into MATLAB as a .py file and is intended to pass a single output value into a simple sorting algorithm.

Our MATLAB sorting algorithm which passes the coin to the correct bin. The algorithm can be downloaded as "sorting_algorithm" 
and ran by running this command : "start_command"
